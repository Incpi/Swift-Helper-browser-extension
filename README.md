This is a browser extension for Swift Chat, a popular messaging app with over 250,000 users. It allows you to access the Web Bot Xamta service, which can help you automate tasks. With this extension, you can easily import and export data from different sources, eliminating the need for manual work.

- It is open source so feel free to check the source code.
